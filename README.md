# Dog-Breed-Classifier-using-CNN
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

Tasks involve evaluating different image classification algorithms for their effectiveness in distinguishing between "dogs" and other subjects. Additionally, assess their performance in identifying specific dog breeds. Keep in mind that classifiers may not always categorize images accurately.

Furthermore, I measured the runtime of each algorithm. This is a crucial factor as computational tasks may trade accuracy for execution speed and resource consumption.
